# Data-Cleaning-with-Python

In this project I worked on two datasets: "Customers" and "Sales" dataset of a company that sells products such as furniture, technology objects and office products.

**My goal is to clean the data using Python, and combine the two datasets in order to proceed with an exploratory data analysis to generate useful insights aimed at business decisions.**

Main tasks:

- Split and Rename columns
- Add columns with conditions, and edit
- Change data type
- Remove Columns
- Check for duplicates
- Manage Missing Values
- Work with dates
- Merging Datasets
