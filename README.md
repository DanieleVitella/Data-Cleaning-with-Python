# Data Cleaning + EDA - Business Performance Analysis: Sales, Profits, and Customer Insights

In this project I worked on two datasets: "Customers" and "Sales" dataset of a company that sells products such as furniture, technology objects and office products.

**Dataset Analysis Description**

In this analysis, a comprehensive examination was conducted on the company's dataset. 

The process involved the following steps:

- **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was meticulously cleaned to ensure accuracy and reliability. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A detailed EDA was performed to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. 
    
    This involved:

    - Calculating descriptive statistics to understand the central tendencies and dispersion.
    - Visualizing data to identify patterns and outliers.
    - Conducting correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
